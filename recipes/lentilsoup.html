</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1-quart vegetable stock (or chicken stock or bone broth)</li><br>
    <li>2 cups filtered water</li><br>
    <li>1 ½ cups lentils, rinsed (soaking is optional)
    </li><br>
    <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li><br>
    <li>1 small yellow or white onion, finely chopped</li><br>
    <li>2 celery ribs, finely chopped</li><br>
    <li>1 large carrot, finely chopped or grated</li><br>
    <li>3–4 cloves garlic, finely chopped or pressed</li><br>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li><br>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li><br>
    <li>1 bay leaf
    </li><br>
    <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar (aged balsamic also works)</li><br>
    <li>1 teaspoon sea salt (I use Real Salt), more or less to taste</li><br>
    <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (about 5 spins in a pepper grinder)</li><br>
    <li>Optional: 2 tomatoes, seeded and chopped (or one 12 oz. can of organic diced tomatoes)
    </li><br>
    <li>Optional: Any greens you’d like to add, look for something in season and at a reasonable price at the store. Spinach is always a great option and has a mild flavor. We like 1 handful of greens per serving.
    </li><br>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Spread the lentils out on a large sheet tray and pick out any debris (aka anything that doesn’t look like a lentil). Legumes are harvested and stored in large quantities, and sometimes little rocks or other things make their way in the bag. </li><br>
        <li>Rinse your lentils well in a fine-mesh strainer before using them.
        </li><br>
        <li>Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large soup pot or Dutch oven. 
        </li><br>
        <li>Add the chopped onion, carrot, and celery with a big pinch of sea salt and cook until tender, about 5-6 minutes.
        </li><br>
        <li>Lower the heat down to medium-low (to prevent the garlic from burning) and add the garlic, cumin, oregano, another pinch of salt, and a few spins of freshly ground black pepper. </li><br>
        <li>Stir and let cook another 2-3 minutes until the mixture is very fragrant. (Be careful not to burn the garlic—turn the heat down to low if necessary, as garlic burns easily.)</li><br>
        <li>Add the bay leaf, 1 teaspoon of salt, a few more spins of black pepper, stock, water, and rinsed lentils to the pot and bring to a full boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. The amount of salt you need will depend on what type of stock you use; start with one teaspoon and add more later to taste if desired. If your stock is not salted, you may need up to 2 (or more) teaspoons).
        </li><br>
        <li>Add the tomatoes (if using).
        </li><br>
        <li>Let the pot simmer for about 40-50 minutes or until the lentils are soft. </li><br>
        <li>Once the lentils are tender, turn off the heat and stir in the vinegar. </li><br>
        <li>Discard the bay leaf before pureeing and serving.
        </li><br>
        <li>Depending on how you like the texture, use a handheld immersion blender to blend 1/3 to 1/2 of the soup. Skip the blending if you prefer a firmer soup texture. If you don’t have an immersion blender, puree 2 cups of the soup in a regular blender or food processor; include some of the soup’s liquid to blend smoothly. Or, blend the whole thing up in a high-speed blender (in batches) to make a silky smooth lentil soup.</li><br>
